              Achieving success in any organization heavily relies on teamwork,
              where individuals can combine their efforts towards a shared goal.
              However, effective teamwork can be a daunting task, as it
              necessitates individuals to overcome personal biases and work
              together towards a common objective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teamwork can encounter issues such as communication breakdowns,
              lack of trust, conflicting opinions, and differing work styles,
              especially in diverse teams with individuals from different
              backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite these challenges, efficient teamwork can result in
              enhanced productivity, increased creativity, and better
              problem-solving capabilities. Recognizing the importance of
              teamwork and working towards overcoming any obstacles is crucial
              to unlocking the full potential of collaborative efforts for both
              individuals and organizations.

              5. What are the different leadership styles?
            </h2>
            <ul>
              <li class="mt-3">
                <h4>Transformational Leadership</h4>
                A manner of leading that prioritizes transformation and change.
                By utilizing their potential, leaders that use this strategy
                hope to motivate their followers to go beyond what they
                previously believed was possible. When a company wants to make
                substantial changes or transformations, this kind of leadership
                can be quite effective.
              </li>
              <li class="mt-3">
                <h4>Delegative Leadership</h4>
                A style of leadership that places a high value on transformation
                and change. Leaders who employ this tactic attempt to inspire
                their followers to go beyond what they previously thought was
                feasible by maximizing their potential. This sort of leadership
                can be quite beneficial when a corporation wishes to make
                significant adjustments or transformations.
              </li>
              <li class="mt-3">
                <h4>Authoritative Leadership</h4>
                Authoritative leaders are often referred to as visionary.
                Leaders who adopt this style consider themselves mentors to
                their followers.
              </li>
              <li class="mt-3">
                <h4>Transactional Leadership</h4>
                Transactional leadership, often referred to as managerial
                leadership, is a leadership style that relies on rewards and
                punishments. This leadership style clearly emphasizes structure,
                assuming individuals may not possess the motivation needed to
                complete their tasks.
              </li>
              <li class="mt-3">
                <h4>Participative Leadership</h4>
                Sometimes referred to as democratic leadership, participative
                leadership is a leadership style that encourages leaders to
                listen to their employees and involve them in the
                decision-making process. This leadership style requires leaders
                to be inclusive, utilize good communication skills, and,
                crucially, be able to share power/responsibility.
              </li>
              <li class="mt-3">
                <h4>Servant Leadership</h4>
                A leadership approach known as servant leadership prioritizes
                the needs of others. It places a great emphasis on developing
                close bonds with those around you and focuses on helping them
                realize their full potential. As a leader, you must concentrate
                on getting to know the team members and enhancing their skills
                while also establishing a positive example and comprehending
                their own objectives.
